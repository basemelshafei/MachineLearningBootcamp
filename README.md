# MachineLearningBootcamp by London App Brewery

Created multiple neural networks to deploy and solve deep learning problems.

Used data science algorithms to analyse data in real life projects, 
such as spam classification and image recognition.

Learned through practical practice how to use the latest tools in data science, including:
Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Numpy, and pandas.

Applied data visualisation techniques to explore large datasets.
